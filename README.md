# IMGA - URL Shortener

A simple URL shortener service built with Go.

## Building and Running

### Basic Build

```bash
go build
go run main.go
```

### Vanilla Docker

```bash
docker build -t imga .
docker run -p 8080:8080 imga
```

### With Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Manual Testing

#### Create Short Code

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"URL":"http://example.com"}' localhost:8080/shorten
```

Should return the following:

```json
{
  "ShortCode": "CTv8Ax",
  "ShortURL": "http://localhost:8080/CTv8Ax",
  "OriginalURL": "http://example.com"
}
```

#### Test Created Short Code

You can run curl in the terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/CTv8Ax
```

This should produce output like this in the terminal window running the program:

```
2025/11/29 20:28:12 Redirecting to original URL: http://example.com
```

Or enter the URL in the browser, and it should redirect you to example.com. You can open devtools and inspect the network tab to see the 302 redirect with the location header.

#### Custom Short Code
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"URL":"http://example.com", "shortcode": "abcdefg"}' localhost:8080/shorten
```

Should return the following:
```json
{
  "ShortCode": "abcdefg",
  "ShortURL": "http://localhost:8080/abcdefg",
  "OriginalURL": "http://example.com"
}
```

If you run it again it should say:
```bash
Short code already exists
```

Note that short codes generated by the service will always be 6 characters, however, custom short codes can be any length


### Assumptions

I have assumed:
- There will never be enough shortcodes to exhaust the possible 6 character combinations
- If a custom short code is taken, it should throw an error rather than generate a new short code

### Additional

If there was more time:
- I would make a more robust logging setup that can be routed elsewhere (or in real life would use a logging package and open telemetry)
- Add better testing for more realistic workloads (concurrent requests, higher volume)

Time spent:
- 3 pomodoros on Friday for core functionality
- 2 pomodoros on Saturday for tests and additional features
- Overall I probably spent over 3 hours completing this assignment
